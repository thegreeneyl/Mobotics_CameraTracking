# YOUniverse_CameraTracking

Standalone openFrameworks 0.12.1 test app for integrating the Mobotix Mx-S74A
cameras (motion + brightness sensors) into the YOUniverse system. It pulls the
authenticated live MJPEG stream, shows both optical modules side by side, and
displays the raw Mx-F-MSA (MultiSense) brightness value parsed from the JPEG
metadata of every frame.

This app is deliberately independent of `YOUniverse_Steuerung` — it exists to
validate camera ingest before any production integration. The
`src/mobotix/` classes have no UI dependencies so Steuerung can reuse them later.

## Hardware

| Unit | Modules | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Mx-S74A #1 (`192.168.178.230`) | M1 + M2: Mx-O-M7SA-8DN050 (4K Day/Night), M3: Mx-F-MSA MultiSense | Motion detection + brightness (north) |
| Mx-S74A #2 (later) | Mx-F-MSA MultiSense | Brightness (west) |

Camera #1 details (verified 2026-09): firmware **MX-V7.3.1.57**, live image
**BOTH** modules side by side at **3840×1080**.

## Build & run

```bash
cd apps/myApps/YOUniverse_CameraTracking
make -j Release
make RunRelease
```

Configuration: copy `bin/data/config/config.example.json` to
`bin/data/config/config.json` (gitignored) and fill in the camera password.
Only the first camera with `"enabled": true` is used in v1; the second CPU
entry is a stub for later.

### Keys / GUI

- `r` — reconnect (also GUI button)
- `p` — toggle preview (downscaled) stream
- `c` — toggle raw JPEG COM metadata dump
- `s` — save a screenshot to `bin/data/`
- GUI: preview toggle, JPEG quality (preview only), COM dump toggle

Headless check: `CAMTRACK_AUTOSHOT=/tmp/shot.png ./YOUniverse_CameraTracking`
streams for ~8 s, saves a screenshot, and exits. Stats are logged every 5 s.

## Stream ingest (what was chosen and why)

**Chosen: authenticated HTTP MJPEG**

```text
http://<ip>/control/faststream.jpg?stream=full&fps=0
```

- `stream=full` — independent JPEGs, decodable natively by OF (FreeImage)
- `fps=0` — maximum frame rate
- `/control/` (user access) — the guest path `/cgi-bin/faststream.jpg` is
  capped at ~2 fps by camera policy
- Auth: camera accepts **Basic and Digest**; the client uses libcurl with
  `CURLAUTH_ANY` (libcurl is already linked by the OF core)

Measured on camera #1 (full 3840×1080 stream, quality 60):

| Path | Result |
|---|---|
| `/control/faststream.jpg?stream=full&fps=0` | **~18 fps decoded, ~5 MB/s, frame age ~50 ms** |
| same + `preview&size=1280x720` | ~5 fps (preview generation is slow on this unit — default **off**) |
| `/cgi-bin/faststream.jpg` (guest) | ~2.3 fps — do not use |

Alternatives considered and rejected for v1:

- **EventStream Client SDK (C++)** — no macOS package (Linux/Windows/RasPi
  only as of 1.2.2). The client is kept behind a small interface so an SDK
  backend can be added later (e.g. on Linux).
- **RTSP/H.264 (port 554)** — higher latency (GOP + client buffering), needs
  an extra decoder, and loses the JPEG comment metadata.
- **MxPEG** — lowest bandwidth but requires the Mobotix decoder; unnecessary
  on a LAN at these rates.

## Brightness / sensor values

Mobotix embeds sensor data in the **JPEG COM comment** of every frame
(`SECTION SENSORS`), not in HTTP headers. Field mapping verified on this
firmware against `/control/camerainfo?text`:

| Field | Meaning | Conversion |
|---|---|---|
| `LA2` | **M3 MultiSense (Mx-F-MSA) illumination** — the brightness-control source | lux = LA2 / 10 |
| `LXL` / `LXR` | Left / right optical module illumination | lux = value / 10 |
| `PI2` | MultiSense PIR activity | percent 0–100 |
| `TC2` | MultiSense temperature | °C = TC2 / 10 |
| `TIN` | Camera board temperature | °C = TIN / 10 |
| `FRJ` | Camera-reported frame rate | fps = FRJ / 10 |

Every stream frame carries these values, so no separate polling is needed.
`JpegCommentParser` extracts them; toggle "show COM dump" to see the raw text.

## Notes / next steps

- The app never writes camera settings (`control?set…`) — per-stream
  parameters (`preview`, `size`, `quality`) only, so the camera's saved
  configuration stays untouched.
- Motion events (Video Motion on M1/M2, PIR on M3) are the next phase:
  camera-side events via IP Notify / MQTT / `event_env` (illumination source
  `cam2` = M3) rather than polling.
- Second S74 (west brightness): add its entry in `config.json` and extend the
  app to run one `MobotixMjpegClient` per camera.
